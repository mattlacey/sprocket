Sprocket
===

A (very) simple tool for processing 16bit RGB files (raw data). Currently supports two operations:

1. Reverse File - reverses the file (well duh)
2. Binary to ASM - converts the binary data into 68k assembly routines to allow direct-to-screen writing when using the true colour mode of the Atari Falcon.

Probably not that useful to all that many people. It's been written from the point of view that the user knows the code, in otherwords there's no bounds checking, buffer overflow protection or any other hand-holding. It's inteded to be used as it's intended to be used.
