Sprocket
===

A (very) simple tool for processing 16bit RGB files (raw data). Currently supports two operations:

1. Reverse File - reverses the file (well duh)
2. Binary to ASM - converts the binary data into 68k assembly routines to allow direct-to-screen writing when using the true colour mode of the Atari Falcon.

Probably not that useful to all that many people.
